# [Python Development Flow](http://#)

[![Build Status](http://#todo)

Python Development Flow is a development workflow aimed at distributed teams working on Python (web) projects.

This sample project shows how a team can collaborate via GitHub, Vagrant powered dev environment Jenkins and a Stackato PAAS on a Python web app (in this case the [httpbin Stackato sample app](https://github.com/Stackato-Apps/httpbin) ) - deployed at http://httpbin.apps.labs.cityindex.com/

The dev ennvironment includes a powerful browser based debugger for Python server side code, powered by [ti-debug](https://github.com/dpb587/ti-debug)
